I have used IAM dataset related to words



IAM dataset:

The data-loader expects the IAM dataset [5] (or any other dataset that is compatible with it) in the data/ directory. Follow these instructions to get the dataset:

Register for free at this website.
Download words/words.tgz.
Download ascii/words.txt.
Put words.txt into the data/ directory.
Create the directory data/words/.
Put the content (directories a01, a02, ...) of words.tgz into data/words/.
Go to data/ and run python checkDirs.py for a rough check if everything is ok.
